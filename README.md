AddContext
========================================
##A Journal With Context

The goal of this app is to centralize, manage, and store any experience in your life worth remembering.
One of my primary goals with this project was to better familiarize myself with Node.  I wished to learn about the Google Maps API, as well as APIs with major social networks - Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Instagram, and Google.  I also wished to utilize the webcam, file uploads, and file management on the server.
